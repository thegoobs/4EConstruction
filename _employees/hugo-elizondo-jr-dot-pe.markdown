In 1995, Hugo joined C.C. Carlton Construction of Austin, Inc., which became C.C. Carlton Industries, Ltd. in 1999.  During his 5-year tenure at this multifaceted construction company, annual billings increased from $1 to $32 million in public works and private development construction. 
 Construction projects ranged from the Travis County Regional Parks to the Lakeway M.U.D. wastewater treatment plant.  Notable Projects are the LCRA/Lakeway Regional Raw Water Intake which has a floating barge on Lake Travis; housing four raw water pumps with 150 HP motors, 250 feet of 16-inch flexible rubber hose and steel manifold and a sophisticated state-of-the-art control system.

Other projects included construction of subsurface drainage systems for the Fazio 2 Golf Course at Barton Creek.  This unique Course lies along the environmentally sensitive Barton Creek watershed.  Projects at this Course included the construction of the main irrigation pump station at Pond 9, a booster pump station, and two water quality ponds which recirculate storm and irrigation runoff.  C.C. Carlton Industries, Ltd. also constructed the Southeast and Northeast Metropolitan Parks for Travis County.  These two new parks included almost $12 million of sports and recreational facilities.  Construction included all earthwork, access drives, parking areas, ball field layout, concession and picnic pavilions, restroom facilities, offsite and onsite water and wastewater improvements, irrigation ponds, pump station, sprinkler systems, electrical and field lighting, landscaping, tennis and basketball courts, soccer fields, equestrian center, hiking trails, and various playscapes.
