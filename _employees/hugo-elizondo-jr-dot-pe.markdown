In 1995, Hugo joined C.C. Carlton Construction of Austin, Inc., which became C.C. Carlton Industries, Ltd. in 1999. During his 5-year tenure at this multifaceted construction company, annual billings increased from $1 to $32 million in public works and private development construction. Construction projects ranged from the Travis County Regional Parks to the Lakeway/M.U.D. Wastewater Treatment Plant. Notable Projects are the LCRA/Lakeway Regional Raw Water Intake which has a floating barge on Lake Travis. It houses four raw water pumps with 150 hp motors, 250 feet of 16-inch flexible rubber hose and steel manifold and a sophisticated state-of-the-art control.

In June 2000, Mr. Elizondo formed Cuatro Consultants, Ltd.
